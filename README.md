# Journey-of-Python-Course 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository is my way of documenting progress as I dive into the world of Python programming. Each folder here represents a chapter I've completed in my Python course.

## What's Inside? 📁

- **Chapters**: Every folder is named after the chapter it contains. Inside, you'll find the code and notes I’ve worked on for that chapter.

- **Practice Sets**: I’ve created a separate folder called `Practice Sets` where you can find additional exercises and solutions to help reinforce the concepts learned in each chapter.

## Why This Repo? 🤔

I'm sharing my Python journey to:

- **Track My Progress**: Keeping everything organized and seeing how far I've come.
- **Help Fellow Students**: If you’re also learning Python, feel free to explore the code, notes, and practice sets. It might help you understand the concepts better!

## How to Use 🛠️

- Clone this repository: `https://github.com/Mystic-persona/Journey-of-Python-Course.git`
- Navigate through the chapter folders to find the one you need.
- Check out the `Practice Sets` folder for extra exercises.
- Open the `.py` files in your preferred Python editor to review and run the code.
